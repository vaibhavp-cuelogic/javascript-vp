<h1>Day 3 Assignment</h1>

<p>1. Write a program to calculate factorial using recursive strategy.</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE: Use factorial(num) for example to calculate factorial of number where num will be any number<br>
For Example: factorial(5) and output will be 120; Result print in console.
</b>
</p>

<br><br>

<p>
	2. Update program - 2 of Practicals Day 2 to add a method that will print name (called printName()) of 	 each student object in its prototype.
</p>

	<b>
    <p>
    NOTE: For above we create one Student class as per specified above and create multiple objects as stud1,stud2 etc. We add one method named as <u>'printName'</u> which prints all the students names. All result is print into console.
    </p>
    </b>

    <br><br>

    <p>3. Write a program that will do the following:</p>
    <p> 1. Accept two string values as arguments, where first value will be a long word(can be any random characters as well), second string will be a single character or substring that will already exist in the first value.</p>
    <p>2. The function should then return an object with properties - 'count' which will count the no of occurrences of substring in the first value, ' lastIndex' which will return the index of             last occurrence of the substring in the first value.  return -1 if the substring can't be found</p>

    <b>
    <p>
     NOTE:- For above created function named as <u>substrOccurance(str,substr)</u> where str will be String first and substr will be second sub string which may be present in string first. For finding result run above function in console so as to get out-put as mentioned above. <br>
     For Example: substrOccurance('This is world,'is');	<br>
     O/P: Object { count=2,  lastIndex=5}
    </p>	
    </b>

    <br><br>

    <p>4. Write a function that will accept a unix timeStamp and covert to its UTC equivalent value</p>
    <b>
    	<p>
    		NOTE:- For above kindly use function named as <u>convertUnixToUTC(timstmp)</u> where timstmp will be unix timestamp value. Result print in console after running above function from console itself.<br>
    		Example: convertUnixToUTC(1475675880);<br>
    		O/P: "Wed, 05 Oct 2016 13:58:00 GMT"
		</p>
    </b>

    <br><br>

    <p>
    	5. Write a function that will accept a single dimensional array whose value will be like ['00','01','11','10','11','00'] and break it into a 2 dimensional array like the following:
    [
        [0,0,1,1,1,0]
        [0,1,1,0,1,0]
    ]
    the  length of array can be dynamic and contain as many values as possible
    </p>
    <b>
    	<p>
    		NOTE:- For above kindly use convert1DTo2DArray(['00','01','10','11','00']); in console.
    	</p>
    </b>
    <br><br>

    <p> 6. Write a program to do the following:</p>

    <p>1. Create an array and add numbers 1 to 100 in it</p>
    <p>2. Print each element of that array in a new line WITHOUT using any loop structure.</p>

    <b>
    	<p>
    		NOTE:- For above use function as <u>printArrayElementWithoutLoopStruct()</u>. Result print in console.
    	</p>
